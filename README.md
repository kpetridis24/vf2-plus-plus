# VF2++
A state-of-the-art algorithm for the **Graph Isomorphism** problem, adjusted for the **Sub-Graph** and 
**Induced Sub-Graph Isomorphism** problems and extended to **directed** and **multigraph** settings.

The **benchmark** results validate the premises of the VF2++ [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X18300829) and illustrate the superiority of the new optimized algorithm, compared to the previous isomorphism solvers.

This implementation is done in a non-recursive manner, saving a lot of space compared to previous recursive solvers.
