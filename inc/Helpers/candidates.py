def find_candidates(u, graph_params, state_params):
    """Given a node u of G1, finds the candidates of u from G2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1,G2: NetworkX Graph or MultiGraph instances.
        The two graphs to check for isomorphism or monomorphism.

    G1_labels,G2_labels: dict
        The label of every node in G1 and G2 respectively.

    u: int
        The node from G1 for which to find the candidates from G2.

    visited: set()
        Contains all the nodes, visited by the DFS so far.

    mapping: dict
        The mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes of G1 to nodes of G2.

    reverse_mapping: dict
        The reverse mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes from G2 to nodes of G1. It's basically "mapping" reversed.

    Returns
    -------
    candidates: set
        The nodes from G2 which are candidates for u.
