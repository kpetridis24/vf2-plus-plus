def update_Tinout(new_node1, new_node2, graph_params, state_params):
    """Updates the Ti/Ti_out (i=1,2) when a new node pair u-v is added to the mapping.

    Notes
    -----
    This function should be called right after the feasibility checks are passed, and node1 is mapped to node2. The
    purpose of this function is to avoid brute force computing of Ti/Ti_out by iterating over all nodes of the graph
    and checking which nodes satisfy the necessary conditions. Instead, in every step of the algorithm we focus
    exclusively on the two nodes that are being added to the mapping, incrementally updating Ti/Ti_out.
    todo: explain how it works

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1,G2: NetworkX Graph or MultiGraph instances.
        The two graphs to check for isomorphism or monomorphism.

    T1, T2: set
        Ti contains uncovered neighbors of covered nodes from Gi, i.e. nodes that are not in the mapping, but are
        neighbors of nodes that are.

    T1_out, T2_out: set
        Ti_out contains all the nodes from Gi, that are neither in the mapping nor in Ti.

    new_node1, new_node2: int
        The two new nodes, added to the mapping.

    mapping: dict
        The mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes of G1 to nodes of G2.

    reverse_mapping: dict
        The reverse mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes from G2 to nodes of G1. It's basically "mapping" reversed.
